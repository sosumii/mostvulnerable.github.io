# Inauthentic Downloads

This is a list of developers that have been hit with a **watering hole attack** or are _potential targets_, and provide _no authentication_ for their software. Some of the software in this list is critical backup software that runs as _root_ to clone disks, like _SuperDuper!_.

_Backup software is the ultimate target of the watering hole attack_.

> Watering hole is a computer attack strategy, in which the victim is a particular group (organization, industry, or region).
> In this attack, the attacker guesses or observes which websites the group often uses and infects one or more of them with malware.
> Eventually, some member of the targeted group gets infected.
>
> Relying on websites that the group trusts makes this strategy efficient, even with groups that are resistant to spear phishing and other forms of phishing.

# FAQ

### What is the functional difference between a checksum and a signature?
>
>* Checksums ensure [data integrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_integrity).
>
>* Digital signatures ensure [data authenticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication).
>
>When downloading a file, errors may occur during that process. Malware also could modify the downloaded file if you're machine is infected. The file's fingerprint (checksum) >is there to tell you that the file is not altered.
>
>An attacker may host a malicious version of *transmission* on his website and makes it available to download. Verifying the checksum in this case is useless: the only way for you to be sure that you did not download a malicious version of *transmission* is to check its signature(s).

### What about Gatekeeper?
>
>* Any Developer ID accepted by Gatekeeper will be allowed to run.
> * _Eg._ Transmission users were autoupdated to compromised binaries with **VALID `codesign` Developer IDs**.
>

### But I love that software. What do I do?
>
>* [Tell them](index.htm#toc1) you would like to keep using their software and you would like to authenticate it with a PGP signature.
> * Some people say they don't understand how PGP works. Some say they don't care.
>
>* Use modern software from developers that are not averse to security best practices.
> * [See Exemplary list below](index.htm#toc3)
